// Some comments on the code in this repo 

//This was a 4 month thesis project, where the majority of the code was ported from an implementation in set of MATLAB scripts.
// The code is very rough and needs a lot of cleanup/refactoring, and contains a lot of disgraceful coding standard violations.
// It was meerly a proof of concept, and good software practices were not as much of a priority as they should/could have been. 
// Attached is the final thesis if you're interested in reading about it.
